# Movie Star Baby Names

## Introduction

As part of my exploration of the ["baby names" dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data), I started to wonder how pop culture had an effect on the popularity of names.  There are various components of pop culture, but I decided to look into the effect popular movies and their stars had on popularity of names.

This repo is a work in progress for a web app to discover patterns between a particular actor's or actress's hit movies and corresponding changes in popularity of baby names.
